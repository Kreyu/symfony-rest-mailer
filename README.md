# REST Mailer

_Send emails using simple HTTP requests._

<img src="doc/img/intro.png">

Emails sent through this application are available to render & preview in the browser.   
This includes their attachments, both attached (classic way) and embedded (using [RFC-2392 Content-ID](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2392)).

Emails are sent asynchronously, and each send attempt (named _transaction_) is stored in the system, available to preview in the browser. This includes details about occurred exceptions when something goes wrong, and Message-ID and SMTP log on success.

## Features

Projects can be defined in the panel, each holding their own transport configuration.

**OAuth 2.0**

_Authentication method you already know and use._

<img src="./doc/img/oauth2.png">

API requires authentication using [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) standard.  
Tokens generated by the clients are visible in the panel, and can be manually removed or revoked.  
Each project can have multiple authentication clients.

**Various transport support**

Emails are sent using the [Symfony Mailer](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html). This means every transport supported by the mailer is automatically supported here.  
This includes built-in transports (`smtp`, `sendmail` and `native`) and 3rd party ones, such as Amazon SES, MailChimp and many more.

List of all supported transports can be found [here](https://symfony.com/doc/current/mailer.html#transport-setup).
